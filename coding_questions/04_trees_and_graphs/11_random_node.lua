    Random Node:

    You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in addition to 
    insert(), find(), and delete(), has a method get_random_node() which returns a 
    random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be hcosen. Design
    and implement an algorithm for get_random_node(), and explain how you would implement
    the rest of the methods.
